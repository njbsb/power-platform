# Requirements

## Approval Workflow

Each request will go through approval workflow depending on the selection of `Request Type` and the discount amount for the requested price.

### First Approval

First stage of approval will go through (1) Manager and the (2) Pricing Manager. The manager refers to the requester's reporting manager, while the Pricing Manger refers to a single person who holds such title in the team. Both approving parties have to approve the request for it to proceed to the next stage.

First approval applies to all types of request raised in the system.

### Second Approval

Second approval will route to the (1) Commercial Director and (2) Operational Marketing Director. While OM Director is a fixed person, the Commercial Director depends on the reporting line of the requester.

Second approval only applies when user selects any of the request type below, or when the discount of the requested material price exceeds 30% of the original material price.

Request type that triggers 2nd approval:

1. Price increase
2. etc.

## List of materials

User should be able to add list of materials and their price to each request. One way to do this is to directly populate within the form interface. User proposed to have a bulk upload template where system would read the data of the uploaded file and populate the list of materials with the data.

## Sales Organisation and Customer Relationship

When a user selects a sales organisation, the user should only be able to select the customer related to the org. For example, when the user selects 'JP', only Japan-related customer should be displayed in the dropdown selection.

## Maintenance of master data (Customer, Material, FX Rate)

The new request form should reference to the latest update in the master data. Administrative user should be able and allowed to maintain this data via form interface inside the app. The system is expected to allow bulk update/upload data from a template into the system's backend.

## Data Export

The system is expected to allow data export via selection of request in the interface. The exported data should be displayed in tabular form via Excel readable format.
